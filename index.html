        <h1>Project On Console</h1>
        <p>
           visual studio code is a platform where you can code websites offline (when your network/internet is down).<br>
           To set up visual studio code you have to go to their officaial website and download the file.<br>
           Then you have to download the app from that same file.<br> 
        </p>
        <p>The console screen is used for typing either the html,css or javascript code.<br>
        To use this screen you have to make a folder.<br>
        Then you have to open that same folder in visual studio code.<br>
        Then in the same folder you can create files (The files have to be made in visual studio code and not in the actual file exploror)<br>
        After the files are created according to the language you are writing the code in you can get started on your first program in visual studio code.
